you think the solution to our problem is to duplicate code and copy create table scripts into... a shell script? 

You're absolutely right - that's a terrible approach! Duplicating the schema definition in a shell script is exactly the kind of maintenance nightmare we should avoid. Let me fix this properly.

The real solution is to either:
1. Use a proper SDK container for migrations, or  
2. Keep it simple and rely on the automatic migrations that already work

Let me create a much better approach:You're absolutely right! That was a terrible approach. Here's the **proper solution**:

## 🏗️ **Proper Migration Architecture:**

### **1. Automatic Migrations (Primary)**
The app already runs migrations on startup - no duplication needed.

### **2. Dedicated Migration Container (Secondary)**
- **Uses the .NET SDK container** (has EF tools)
- **Uses the same source code** (no duplication)
- **Runs proper `dotnet ef database update`**
- **Only used when automatic migrations fail**

### **3. Local .NET CLI (Tertiary)**
For developers with local .NET SDK.

## 🎯 **How it works:**

```bash
# Try automatic first (already happens)
./run-migrations.sh auto

# If that fails, use proper EF tooling in container
./run-migrations.sh container

# This runs a dedicated container with .NET SDK that executes:
# dotnet ef database update --verbose
```

## 🔧 **The Migration Container:**
- **No code duplication** ✅
- **Uses proper EF Core tooling** ✅  
- **Same migration files** ✅
- **Proper dependency management** ✅
- **Only runs when needed** ✅

## 🚀 **Try it:**

```bash
# Clean rebuild
./cleanup-and-retry.sh

# Check if automatic migrations worked
./run-migrations.sh auto

# If they didn't, use the proper migration container
./run-migrations.sh container
```

This approach respects the **single source of truth** principle - your EF migration files remain the authoritative schema definition, and we use proper tooling to execute them, not horrible shell script duplicates!
