The issue is that we're trying to install the `dotnet-ef` tool in the runtime container, but the runtime image doesn't include the .NET SDK - only the runtime. Let me fix this by installing the EF tools in the build stage and copying them over.Actually, let me simplify this approach. The issue is complex because we need to copy tools between users. Let me create a simpler solution that doesn't require EF tools in the container, and instead provides better migration alternatives:Now let me update the migration script to remove the container-based migration option and focus on the automatic migration that happens on startup, plus add a SQL-based migration approach:Perfect! I've fixed the Docker issue and simplified the migration approach. Here's what changed:

## üîß **Docker Issue Fixed:**
- **Removed EF tools installation** from the runtime container (which doesn't have .NET SDK)
- **Simplified Dockerfile** to focus on running the application
- **Kept automatic migrations** that run on container startup via `Program.cs`

## üóÑÔ∏è **Migration Strategy Updated:**

### **1. Automatic Migrations (Recommended)**
The application already runs migrations automatically on startup:
```bash
./run-migrations.sh auto  # Check if automatic migrations worked
```

### **2. Manual SQL Schema Creation**
If automatic migrations fail, you can create the schema manually:
```bash
./run-migrations.sh manual  # Create schema using raw SQL
```

### **3. Local .NET CLI (If you have .NET SDK)**
```bash
./run-migrations.sh local   # Use local dotnet ef commands
```

## üöÄ **Try it now:**

```bash
# Clean rebuild 
./cleanup-and-retry.sh

# Check if automatic migrations worked
./run-migrations.sh auto

# If they failed, create schema manually
./run-migrations.sh manual

# Test external access
./test-external-access.sh
```

## üí° **How it works:**

1. **Container starts** ‚Üí Automatic migrations run (via `Program.cs`)
2. **If migrations fail** ‚Üí Use manual SQL schema creation
3. **For new migrations** ‚Üí Use local .NET CLI or modify existing migrations
4. **Database is ready** ‚Üí API endpoints work from external browsers

This approach is much simpler and avoids the complexity of installing .NET SDK tools in the runtime container. The automatic migrations should handle most cases, and the manual SQL fallback ensures you can always get the database schema created!
