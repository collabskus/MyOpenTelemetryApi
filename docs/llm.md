so to recap 
the actual secrets should exist only in the API layer for example we interact with the database in the infrastructure but we should pass this password on from the API layer and not directly in the infrastructure, however, the nuget dependencies in the infrastructure should live there and should not be passed from the API? is that correct? 





**Exactly right!** You've got it perfectly. Let me confirm your understanding:

## **Secrets/Configuration: Flow DOWN (API â†’ Infrastructure)**

```
API Layer (appsettings.json)
    â†“ passes connection string
Infrastructure Layer (uses it)
```

**Example in your API's Program.cs:**
```csharp
// API layer reads the secret
var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");

// API layer passes it to Infrastructure
builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseNpgsql(connectionString));
```

The Infrastructure layer **receives** the connection string but doesn't know where it came from. It could be from:
- appsettings.json
- User secrets
- Environment variables
- Azure Key Vault
- etc.

## **NuGet Dependencies: Stay in Their Layer**

```
Infrastructure Layer
    - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
    - Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
    - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
    â†“ (transitive dependencies flow up automatically)
API Layer (gets EF Core functionality through project reference)
```

The API layer **doesn't directly reference** EF Core packages, but it can still use EF Core because:
1. It references the Infrastructure project
2. .NET automatically includes Infrastructure's dependencies
3. This is called "transitive dependency flow"

---

## **The Key Principle**

| **What** | **Where It Lives** | **Direction of Flow** |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Secrets/Config** | API layer | Flows DOWN (API â†’ Infrastructure) |
| **NuGet Packages** | Infrastructure layer | Flows UP (Infrastructure â†’ API transitively) |
| **Business Logic** | Application layer | Used by API |
| **Domain Models** | Domain layer | Used by everyone |

---

## **Your Mental Model Should Be:**

- **Configuration/Secrets** = Runtime concerns = Start at the entry point (API) and flow down
- **Code Dependencies** = Compile-time concerns = Live in the layer that needs them, flow up through project references

You've nailed the clean architecture dependency rules! ðŸŽ¯
